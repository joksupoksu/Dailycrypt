DailyCrypt
==========
Because everyone should be aware of personal file encryption. And everyone should have a way to do it even wihtout advanced IT-experience. 

DailyCrypt is an open-source personal file encryption software. It is a part of our study called "Encryption in everyday life" which is was compening in Intel ISEF 2017 in the category of system software. Our project won special award from Qatar Foundation.

DailyCrypt is intented for basic users so there are not very much advanced features. We use AES-256 for encryption.

Project has been done with Python 3 and Kivy 1.9 and can be compiled with Kivy.
Already compiled versions shall be available soon for Windows, Mac and Debian-based Linux systems. (and maybe Android)

Usage of the software is quite simple (And we've won an award for that) and shouldn't need any instructions.
